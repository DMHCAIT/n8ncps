### Key Metrics to Watch

- **Position Count**: Don't over-diversify with limited capital
- **P&L**: Track daily and overall performance  
- **Gap Triggers**: Verify buy signals are reasonable

### Daily Routine

2. **During Market**: Monitor positions and alerts
3. **Evening**: Review day's trades and P&L

- **Regular Reviews**: Weekly analysis of performance

### Position Management  
- **Don't Hold Overnight**: This is a day-trading strategy
- **Take Profits**: Don't get greedy, stick to 3% target
- **Cut Losses**: Manually exit positions at 5% loss
- **Avoid FOMO**: Don't chase every gap-down

### System Maintenance
- **Daily ACCESS_TOKEN**: Regenerate every morning
- **Monitor Logs**: Check console output for errors

- **Update Strategy**: Adjust parameters based on performance

## üìà Gradual Scaling Strategy

### Week 1: Minimal Risk

- WATCHLIST = 1-2 most liquid ETFs
- Monitor every 15 minutes

### Week 2-3: Cautious Expansion

- WATCHLIST = 3-4 ETFs
- Monitor every 30 minutes

### Week 4+: Full Operation

For daily manual renewal:
