# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED (Latest Update)**
**UnhashableParamError** has been resolved! The app was crashing because Streamlit couldn't cache functions with KiteConnect objects. This is now fixed with separated caching logic.

## 🔧 **FIXING CONNECTION ISSUE**

Your Streamlit Cloud app is not connecting because the environment variables are missing.

### 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP FIX**

1. **🌐 Open your app**: https://n8ncps-imny4jmu7twewjlglskjxh.streamlit.app/

2. **⚙️ Click "Manage app"** (bottom right corner of the app)

3. **🔐 Go to "Secrets" tab**

4. **📝 Copy and paste EXACTLY this content**:
   ```toml
   KITE_API_KEY = "i0bd6xlyqau3ivqe"
   KITE_API_SECRET = "s2x3rpgijq921qmjgcerzqj3x6tkge6p"
   KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN = "qz68Wy7GQ7kSvdxnxvQlwgCeWYmcTpvQ"
   DRY_RUN = "false"
   ```

5. **💾 Click "Save"**

6. **🔄 App will automatically restart**

7. **✅ App should now work**: Connection status will show "Connected"

### 🚨 **IMPORTANT NOTES**

- **Daily Token Refresh**: The access token expires daily and needs to be updated
- **Security**: Never share your API keys or tokens publicly
- **Testing**: Use DRY_RUN = "true" for testing, "false" for live trading

### 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULT**

After adding secrets, your app should show:
- ✅ "Connected to Zerodha as: [Your Name]"
- 💰 Account balance display
- 📊 All trading features active

### 🔄 **IF STILL NOT WORKING**

1. Check if secrets are saved correctly
2. Try restarting the app manually
3. Verify API credentials are correct
4. Generate a fresh access token if needed
